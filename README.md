# One-shot-learning-for-plastic-Waste-classification

The repository contains 2 files - The siamese and triplet loss convolutional neural networks for one shot classifcation of plastic waste images. 
The images are obtained from the WaDaBa Dataset and can be requested through http://wadaba.pcz.pl/ .
Our method achieves over a 99% accuracy using both the triplet and siamese networks.
